<h2>About</h2>
<br><br>
<h3>Growing up, I was always fascinated with animation of characters, design, and storytelling. I would spend a fair amount of time watching movies from Disney and Pixar to learn how the characters interacted and developed in the story. The art style was another element that resonated with me deeply. Seeing different art styles and color choices between movies made me understand that this aspect also plays a major role in storytelling. Thus, my passion for art developed in character creation and storytelling.
<br><br>
With the help of design software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, I create my artwork in a variety of art styles that help me develop a narrative for a story. This process can be within a single illustration or a series of them depending on the message and purpose of the artwork. Furthermore, I based my work on the premise that a picture can sometimes tell more than words. I focus on creating a visual narrative for my characters more so than a written story. With this, I am not saying that there is no need to write a story, or that it is not important. What I am saying is that a story can be greatly enhanced with the use of the right image. Therefore, I always take into consideration the context and emotion that I am trying to convey when designing a landscape or a character.
<br><br>
When creating a character, I pay attention to the details such as the context in which the character develops and what are the emotions involved at the moment. Details like facial expressions and body language are key factors for me to develop my artwork. Additionally, I take in consideration other elements. For example, the use of shadows which allows me to convey a more striking image while the use of colors help in setting the tone for emotions. For me, the eyes are the main focus for the majority of my work because I believe they are the windows that express the feelings. Thus, when designing a character, I think first of what kind of emotion the character is conveying to the viewer as I like to imagine of a narrative that goes with it.
<br><br>
Overall, I like to think of my artwork as a window of expression. My designs involve adding parts of myself into the work with the purpose of relating to others. The creation of my artwork is a reflection of some aspects of my personal experiences as well, happiness, or sadness. Consequently, I want the viewer to be able to experience the emotions conveyed through my work and to imagine the story that is being told.
