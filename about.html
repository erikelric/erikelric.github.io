        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>My work is a mixture of old and new concepts ranging from medieval influences to sci-fi themes. My main approach is character design. Through body and facial expressions, I tell the story of a particular character taking as a reference my
          own
          life experiences as well as others. My goal is to connect my art with the audience to an emotional level so they can relate to the emotions presented. Therefore, my objective is simple. I like to create heroes because I believe them to
          represent
          the best part of ourselves as we imagine being one of them.
        </h3>

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Born in Mexico, I grew up reading stories about brave heroes and their mighty adventures. This led me to movies and consequently video games where I found my passion for drawing. I would spend a fair amount of time watching movies from
          Disney
          and Pixar to learn how the characters interacted and developed in the story. The art style was another element that resonated with me deeply. Seeing different art styles and color choices between movies made me understand that this aspect
          also
          plays a major role in storytelling. Thus, my passion for art developed character creation and storytelling.
          <br><br>
          It was not until I moved to the United States when I decided to pursue my career as an artist. After a year studying fine arts, I realized that I wanted to take a more digital approach, leading me to start studying graphic design,
          animation, and
          3D modeling.
          <br><br>
          Currently, I am a year away from graduating to obtain my undergraduate degree and start searching for a job within the entertainment industry.
