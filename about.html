<h2>About</h2>
<br><br>
<h3>Growing up, I was always fascinated with animation of characters, design, and storytelling. I would spend a fair amount of time watching movies from Disney and Pixar to learn how the characters interacted and developed in the story. The art style was another element that resonated with me deeply. Seeing different art styles between movies made me understand that this aspect plays also a major role in storytelling. Thus, my passion for art lies in character creation and storytelling.
<br><br>
With the help of designing software like Photoshop or Illustrator, I create my artwork in a variety of art styles that help develop a narrative for a story within a single illustration. Furthermore, I based my work on the premise that a picture can tell more than words. I focus on creating a narrative for my characters that later on are added to the story. With this, I am not disregarding the fact that there must be a story to follow. What I am saying is that a story can be greatly enhanced with the use of the right image. Therefore, I always take into consideration the context and emotion when creating a landscape or a character.
<br><br>
When creating a character I pay attention to the details such as the context in which the character develops and what are the emotions at play at the moment. For example, the use of shadows allows me to convey a more striking image while the use of colors assists in setting the tone for emotions. For me, the eyes are the main factor of my artwork. Thus, when designing a character, I think first of what kind of emotion this character is conveying to the viewer as I like to imagine of narrative that goes with it.
<br><br>
Overall, creating a character involves not only the technical skill and information given. For me, this involves adding part of myself into the artwork. The creation of my artwork is a reflection of some aspects of my personal experiences, happiness, or sadness. Consequently, my artworks are also a showcase of those emotions.
