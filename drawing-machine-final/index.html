    <h1>HARMONY</h1>
    <p>Personally, symmetry has always been a fascinating concept when it comes to design. This principle conveys a harmonious set of proportions and overall balance. With that being said, when observing a symmetrical design we can feel that sense of harmony. Therefore, the purpose of this drawing machine is to reflect that principle of balance in which the user can create harmonious designs that can later be saved. </p>
    <h3>Use your mouse to draw symmetrically</h3>
